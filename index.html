            <h1><strong>2. Business Blogs:</strong></h1>
            <p>Blogs oriented toward businesses are called business blogs. The business bloggers tend to write on the
                topic
                related to the work they do for a living. A business blog aims to generate more leads for their
                businesses
                and make as many potential customers as possible. The topics of the business blog posts will strictly be
                around the industry they are aligned with.</p>

                <h1><strong>4. Affiliate Blogs.</strong></h1>
                <p>Affiliate blogs are built to generate commission through affiliate marketing. In affiliate marketing, you
                    get
                    paid a small percentage of the sale amount that&rsquo;s been made through you. An affiliate blogger
                    writes
                    product reviews and asks their readers to purchase those products through their affiliate links. Once a
                transaction is made, the blogger gets a small kickback from it.</p>
            <p>A successful affiliate blog aims to promote third party products and services to its audience. To run an
                affiliate blog successfully, you&rsquo;ll have to write convincing reviews of the products and services
                you
                are endorsing. Half-hearted reviews that aren&rsquo;t convincing won&rsquo;t generate any revenue.
                You&rsquo;ll need conviction in your writing.</p>
